# MosaicMeOSX
Final project for CS E-50 at Harvard Extension School

Read the readme.pdf for the most detail. You can see a demonstration of the app here: https://vimeo.com/107306782.
This is a MacOSX app that tiles images into a single image of your choice. This repository has a folder of image you
can use or you can try it with your own set of images.
